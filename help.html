        <h2>Short Tutorial</h2>

        Odinochka is a tab vault, in the style of OneTab or Toby, but
        developer-centric.  It is designed to be lightweight yet featureful.
        <p>

        <h3>Saving Tabs</h3>
        Instead of closing a tab and losing it forever, or opening 300 tabs,
        crashing your browser, and losing all of them forever, you can save
        tabs to Odinochka's database. <p>

        To save your current tab to Odinochka, click the extension's icon on
        your toolbar (or press Alt-T). <p>

        Right clicking the icon will show a context menu, containing several
        variants to save groups of tabs all at once. <p>

        <h3> Viewing and Restoring Tabs</h3>
        Click 'show' in the toolbar menu (or Alt-Shift-O) to view your saved
        tabs. 'help' will show this page. <p>

        Tabs are organized into groups. To open a whole group of tabs at once,
        shift-double click the title. You can also click the pop-up x to
        delete a group. <p>

        You can edit group names by double clicking on a group header (press tab
        when done). If you add the word "lock" to a group name, you will be
        prevented from deleting it. <p>

        You can also drag-and-drop to organize your lists of tabs. <p>

        Clicking the popdown arrow after a youtube link will open a mini-player.
        Click X to close it.
                                         

        <h2>Options</h2>

        Click the hamburger icon (&#x2630;) in the footer of Odinocha to pop
        open an options dialog, which will allow you to adjust how Odinochka
        saves and restores tabs. <p>

        automated cloud backups.
